0.62_01   2019-01-01 04:23:23 -0500
  - New type: array of string "string [x]" and "string []" are supported
  - NULL terminated arrays are supported as return types for string and opaque arrays
    "opaque []" and "string []"

0.61_01   2018-12-31 19:56:20 -0500
  - New type: pointers to string "string *" are supported.
  - FFI::Platypus::Type::StringPointer is now deprecated.

0.60_01   2018-12-30 14:55:15 -0500
  - sticky/unstick functions can safely be called multiple times

0.58      2018-11-20 14:31:10 -0500
  - Add unstick method to FFI::Platypus::Closure

0.57_01   2018-11-04 15:36:33 -0500
  - Major refactor of the internals of the type system.  The API is
    the same but some type meta-data (which was never guaranteed
    to stay the same) may have changed.

    * The internal representation of types is much smaller (4 bytes
      for simple types), which can save a lot of memory if you have
      lots of types.

    * Fixed width strings example: `string(32)` are now internally
      treated the same as a record with no class `record(32)`.
      Previously these were separate types but worked identically,
      this removes duplicate code.

    * Fixed width string arguments to a closure are now read-only,
      Usually you should be copying these arguments anyway.

    * Removed the internal type "exotic float" which includes
      `long double`, `complex float` and `complex double`.  These are
      now grouped internally with other scalar types.

  - Merge FFI::Platypus::Type::StringArray into this distribution

0.56      2018-09-03 09:17:42 -0400
  - lib method accepts code reference which will be called immediately
    and results added to lib list

0.55      2018-08-29 10:37:36 -0400
  - Production release identical to 0.54_03

0.54_03   2018-08-28 10:46:04 -0400
  - Additional test diagnostics.

0.54_02   2018-08-28 05:30:04 -0400
  - record as closure argument is now read-only.  This makes
    sense since such records are actually copies.  For when
    you need a non-copy use an opaque type instead.  This allows
    records with rw strings (although they will be ro in the
    closure).

0.54_01   2018-08-16 03:27:31 -0400
  - Experimental: allow record as closure argument
    Records with string_rw are not supported, and
    will likely crash your script if you try to use
    them.  Support for such records is probably not in
    the cards, but a future version may disallow them
    to avoid crashes.
  - Closure objects now have a sticky method, similar to what
    is already available in the discouraged FFI::Platypus::Declare
    interface

0.53      2018-08-15 20:38:29 -0400
  - Production release identical to 0.52_04

  - Work-around for Strawberry Perl 5.14.4 unicode bug (see gh#85)

0.52_03   2018-08-14 15:28:19 -0400
  - Major refactoring of test suite

0.52_02   2018-08-14 08:05:07 -0400
  - Added standard RTLD_ constants to FFI::Platypus::DL
  - Fixed long standing but till now unused bug on Windows where dlopen was
    returning a handle for libraries that weren't actually being loaded.

0.52_01   2018-08-13 20:39:32 -0400
  - Testing: moved libtest to t/ffi, using the same convention as FFI::Build
  - Added FFI::Platypus::DL.  Previously this had been (under a different
    name) a private interface to libdl used by FFI::Platypus under the covers.
    On Windows it is an emulation layer over the native equivalents.

0.51      2018-08-09 03:14:15 -0400

0.49_03   2018-05-19 10:09:15 -0400
  - The previous version contained build files that would break the install
    unless you were building on my machine.  This is what the previous
    version should have been.

0.49_02   2018-05-18 22:08:43 -0400
  - Fix version mismatch error with XS

0.49_01   2018-05-18 16:16:13 -0400

    The new URL is https://github.org/Perl5-FFI/FFI-Platypus
  - Remove dependency on JSON::PP, use Data::Dumper for build configuration.
    This may improve startup performance.

0.48      2018-02-20 09:37:32 -0500
  - setting lib => undef is now the same as setting it to [undef] in the constructor
    (previously lib => undef was ignored)

0.47      2017-03-23 18:26:01 -0400
  - Fix installer bug where My::ShareConfig was accidentally declared as a
    prereq

0.46      2017-03-23 15:47:29 -0400

  - You can now control which implementation of strdup FFI::Platypus::Memory uses
    via the FFI_PLATYPUS_MEMORY_STRDUP_IMPL environment variable.

0.43      2016-07-08 03:28:57 -0400
  - Numerous fixes for systems with 64bit big-endian arch
    (previously only 32bit big-endian had been tested)
  - Officially discourage the use of FFI::Platypus::Declare

0.42      2016-05-06 16:31:01 -0400
  - Support for MSYS2

0.41      2016-04-09 16:03:07 -0400
  - For the return value undef can be passed in to mean 'void'.

    was mounted noexec
  - Avoid unnecessary downgrade on when Perl is compiled to use longdouble

0.40      2015-08-29 08:45:19 -0400
  - Closure declerations ignore white space between () and ->

0.39      2015-08-24 03:23:10 -0400
  - Fixed spurious warning: auto loading of record class (via FFI::Platypus::Record)
    was ALWAYS warning, when it should have only been warning on load failure.

0.38      2015-08-13 17:13:07 -0400
  - closure method now comes with a more useful diagnostic thinks to
    Carp::croak
  - Added a check for standard C headers.  This seems to help the configure
    stage find ptrdiff_t, which was frequently not detected correctly
    (at least on Linux).
  - Improved thread safety by using MY_CXT for some very infrequently used
    global variables.
  - Added IRC meta data information for metacpan.org.  Please join us at
    #native on irc.perl.org!
  - Many minor documentation corrections and tweaks.  Most significant is
    that Convert::Binary::C can now be recommended as it is once again
    properly maintained.
  - Added tests for threads and forks.  If these tests fail in your environment
    please let me know!

0.37      2015-05-29 14:28:21 -0400

  - Explicitly require constant pragma version 1.32

0.35      2015-05-29 12:06:39 -0400
  - FFI::Platypus::Record uses constant to create size of alignment constants
    instead of creating them with a sub reference (this usage was deprecated
    in Perl 5.22)

0.34      2015-05-07 09:27:04 -0400
  - Require Alien::FFI which is more reliable at configure time on some platforms

  - Make sure -L flags from Alien::FFI come before those in perl Config
    For more reliable builds

    Alien::FFI 0.09 or beter)

0.31      2015-02-26 13:41:23 -0500
  - Fix bug involving wide custom arguments
    "wide" meaning where a single Perl argument is translated
    into multiple machine code arguments.  (pipcet++ gh#43)

0.30      2015-02-25 17:50:54 -0500
  - You can now pass an opaque in place of a closure type (pipcet++ gh#40,gh#41)
  - FFI closures are now cached and can be reused if the same closure is passed
    repeatedly (pipcet++ gh#40,gh#42)
  - Passing non-reference to scalar as a pointer argument will now issue a warning
    (gh#5)

0.29      2015-02-24 08:50:34 -0500
  - Delayed loading of Win32::ErrorMode to avoid build prereq failure on Windows

  - Added support for pointers to longdouble (in C "long double *") type
  - Added support for array of longdouble (in C "long double []") type
  - Added tied array interface for record array members (see FFI::Platypus::Record::TieArray)
    Marked as EXPERIMENTAL
  - Array members of records can now be accessed (set/get) by element
  - Array members of records types are now documented (see FFI::Platypus::Record)
  - Bugfix: array wasn't being updated on return for variable length
    array types
  - Should now build with an Alien::FFI that was built with ALIEN_FORCE=1

0.25      2015-02-16 20:18:41 -0500
  - Probe for proper long double support instead of trusting ffi.h
  - This disables long double support on cygwin, which does not seem to
    work, at least in so far as it seems to work on other platforms
    patches to prove otherwise are welcome.

  - Accept additional extensions, in addition to dlext
    Example: on OS X both .bundle and .dylib can be used
    Example: although arguably wrong, on cygwin sometimes .so is used
  - Added Module::Build::FFI->ffi_dlext class method

0.18      2015-01-30 15:22:07 -0500
  - Improved support for C++ in Module::Build::FFI
  - Module::Build::FFI can now be subclassed to support foreign
    languages other than C and C++.  See Module::Build::FFI::Rust as an
    example.

  - Allow integer and floating point type default to 0 when not provided
    without warning
  - You can now take the sizeof a custom type (it will be the size of
    the native type that is actually passed on the C argument stack).
  - Sizeof should be faster now as it doesn't look up the other meta
    information or create a hash to contain it
  - Added record type see FFI::Platypus::Type#Records
  - Added bool as a primitive type.

0.16      2015-01-23 17:31:00 -0500
  - Bumping Alien::FFI version requirement up to 0.04
    Thus indirectly Alien::Base to 0.07
    Believe this may fix a cpan testers failure that I am seeing
